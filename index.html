                <h2>Problem statement:</h2>
                <p>The urgency of addressing climate change is evident in the recent events we've witnessed. With the warmest July on record in 2023 and a rise in water levels by 102mm since 1940, we stand at the precipice of a catastrophic tipping point. While it's true that G8 countries bear a significant responsibility, producing 80% of global carbon emissions, it's equally crucial for us as states, communities, and individuals to take action. We cannot afford to shift blame; it's our collective responsibility to make meaningful changes and raise our voices. If we don't act now, we risk regretting that we did too little, too late.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="heading">
                <h2>Context:</h2>
                <p>Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges facing our world  today. It is already having a devastating impact on people and ecosystems around the globe, and its effects are only going to get worse if we do not take action now.
                    The good news is that climate change is also an opportunity to create a better future for all. By transitioning to a clean energy economy, we can create jobs, reduce poverty, and improve the lives of billions of people.             
                
            <P> The following data points show how climate change is interconnected to other development issues:</P>
                    </p>
                <strong>SDG1.Poverty reduction: </strong>  
                    <p> Climate change is disproportionately impacting the poor, who are more vulnerable to extreme weather events and have fewer resources to cope with the effects of climate change. A study by the World Bank found that climate change could push an additional 100 million people into extreme poverty by 2030.</p>
                <strong> SDG2. Job creation:</strong> 
                    <p>  The transition to a clean energy economy is expected to create millions of new jobs in industries such as renewable energy, energy efficiency, and green transportation. A study by the International Renewable Energy Agency found that the renewable energy sector could create 28 million new jobs worldwide by 2050.
                    </p>
                    <strong> SDG 3AND 4. Human capital, health, and education:</strong>
                    <p> Climate change is already having a negative impact on human health, education, and productivity. For example, extreme heat waves can lead to heatstroke and other health problems, and air pollution can reduce children's cognitive development.
                    </p>
                <strong>SDG 5 AND 10. Gender and youth Empowerment :</strong> 
                    <p>  Climate change is having a disproportionate impact on women and girls, who are more likely to live in poverty and be dependent on natural resources. Climate change is also exacerbating existing gender inequalities.
                    </p>
                <strong> SDG 2. Food security:</strong>
                    <p> Climate change is disrupting agricultural production and making it more difficult to grow food. This is leading to food insecurity and hunger around the world.
                    </p>
                    <strong>SDG 6 AND 7. Access to clean air, water, and affordable energy: </strong> 
                    <p>Climate change is making it more difficult to access clean air, water, and affordable energy. For example, droughts can lead to water shortages, and 
                        sea level rise can contaminate coastal water supplies.</p>

                    <strong> SDG 17. Fiscal and debt management: </strong>
                    <p>Climate change is already costing governments billions of dollars in disaster relief and other costs. These costs are only going to increase in the future.
                    </p>
                    <strong>SDG 16. Conflict and fragility:</strong> 
                    <p> Climate change can exacerbate conflict and fragility by increasing competition for resources and creating new displacement patterns.
                    </p>
                   
                   <div class="heading">
                    <p> The following data points show how we can use alternate energy methods with government policies to better all other SDGs that also let us achieve our climate change goals:
                    </p>
                    <p>  A study by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) found that renewable energy sources can provide up to 90% of global electricity needs by 2050.
                    </p>
                    <p>  A study by the International Energy Agency found that investing in renewable energy and energy efficiency could create 21 million new jobs worldwide by 2030.
                    </p>
                    <p>  A study by the World Health Organization found that reducing air pollution from fossil fuels could save up to 7 million lives worldwide each year.
                    </p>
                    <p> A study by the World Bank found that investing in renewable energy could help to lift 100 million people out of poverty by 2030.
                    </p>
                    <p>  Government policies can play a key role in promoting the transition to a clean energy economy. For example, governments can provide subsidies for renewable energy, invest in public transportation, and put a price on carbon emissions.
                        (Give reference of Pakistan and India adding more renewable and the one government that properly taxed the country for switching to renewable.use that WBank study that we downloaded with 25 hope cases.)

                <h2>The Pathway to a Sustainable Tomorrow: Combating Climate Change Challenges:</h2>
                <p>To achieve a Zero-Carbon Future, decarbonizing development requires comprehensive strategies:

                    Long-term Planning: Establish clear, long-term goals (e.g., 2050) and short-term targets (e.g., 2025). Continuous monitoring and feedback are essential for progress.
                    
                    Price Reforms: Implement reforms, such as carbon pricing and taxation, to drive decarbonization efforts. Current global initiatives fall short of meeting climate stabilization goals.
                    
                    Sectoral Transitions: Utilize various policies, from regulations to subsidies, to facilitate shifts in key sectors like energy and food. These policies stimulate both technology development ("supply-push") and demand ("demand-pull").
                    
                    Financial Support: Climate finance must quadruple by 2030. Policies encouraging private sector involvement and managing climate risks are vital due to limited public funding.
                    
                    Just Transition: Address disparities caused by climate policies. Proactive communication and fair impact management are crucial for garnering public support.</p>
